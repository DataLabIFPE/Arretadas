    - assets/Infor_04.png
    - assets/Infor_05.png

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a

  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Exo

      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Rounded_Elegance.ttf

  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
